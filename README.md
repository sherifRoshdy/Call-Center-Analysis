This project aims to create an interactive dashboard that displays key metrics and insights for a call center using Power BI. The dashboard is based on a sample Excel data set that contains information about the calls, agents, and departments of a fictional call center.

## Features

The dashboard has the following features:

- A scroll bar that allows the user to select and analyze the data for a specific week.
- A speedometer chart that shows the overall satisfaction score for the selected week.
- A bar chart that shows the satisfaction score for each agent, with a smiley icon indicating if the score is above 3.5.
- A table that shows the total calls, calls answered, average answer speed, call resolution percentage, and call resolution trend for each agent. The table can be sorted by any of the metrics using radio buttons.
- A pie chart that shows the call abandon rate by department.

## Benefits

The dashboard provides several benefits for the call center managers and teams, such as:

- Monitoring and optimizing the performance of the call center on a weekly basis.
- Identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each agent and department.
- Spotting emerging trends and patterns in the call data.
- Improving customer service and satisfaction levels.
